    <h2>Channapatna Toys:</h2>
    <p>
      Channapatna toys are a particular form of wooden toys and dolls that are manufactured in the town of Channapatna (
      12.87 Sq.K.M) in the Ramanagara district of Karnataka state, <br> India. This traditional craft is protected as a
      geographical indication (GI) under the World Trade Organization, administered by the Government of Karnataka. As a
      result of the <br> popularity of these toys, Channapatna is known as Gombegala Ooru (toy-town) of Karnataka.
      Traditionally, the work involved lacquering the wood of the Wrightia tinctoria tree, <br> colloquially called Aale
      mara (ivory-wood).
    <h3>History:</h3>
    Lacquered toys find mentioned in vachanas of Basavanna during 11th-12th century CE in Karnataka. Although the use of
    Lac (lacquer resin) for wood finish, cosmetics, toys, <br> bangles and dye is much earlier in ancient India. This
    natural Lac resin was once imported in sizeable quantity into Europe from India. Under various local rulers like
    Hoysalas, <br> Vijayanagara and Mysore Kingdom it received patronage from royals and commoners alike. Bavas Miyan
    helped renew channapatana toys during it's decline, he adopted Japanese <br> technology for toys making and helped
    the local artisans improve their art. For nearly two centuries, ivory-wood was the main wood used in the making of
    these toys, though <br> rosewood and sandalwood were also occasionally used.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Manufacturing:</h3>
    The craft has diversified over time; in addition to the traditional ivory-wood, other woods—including rubber,
    sycamore, cedar, pine and teak—are now used as well. Manufacturing <br> stages include procuring the wood, seasoning
    the wood, cutting the wood into the desired shapes, pruning and carving the toys, applying the colours and finally
    polishing the finished <br> product. Vegetable dyes are used in the colouring process to ensure that the toys and
    dolls are safe for use by children. As of Oct 2011, has population of 71,902, in which 254 are in <br> home
    manufacturing units and 50 in small factories, were engaged in the making of these toys. The Karnataka Handicrafts
    Development Corporation (KHDC) provides assistance with <br> marketing efforts. The oldest and most popular
    manufacturing unit Bharath Art and crafts help develop innovative products.
